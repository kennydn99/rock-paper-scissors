# rock-paper-scissors
I will be creating my first JavaScript program from scratch. This project will be
a simple implementation of the "rock paper scissors" game.

Initially this will be implemented only in the console. In the future. I will add a GUI to the game.

This project will demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript so far and allow me to practice 
and learn more as I work towards implementing this game.
